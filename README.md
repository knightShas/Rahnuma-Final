Hope all of you have already know how to set up your localhost database 
I have updated some of the pages and restructured the blog.

For viewing all those changes pls replace your database with the new given one in the repo. 
All the changes you can observe. 

And if any one wnat to modify any blog you can do it with the admin and make sure the every time you edit the blog pls add the photo that you want to display. It is not tracking the file after you are updating the file so you have to select the image file again n again every time you edit the blog.

If any problem ask me.
